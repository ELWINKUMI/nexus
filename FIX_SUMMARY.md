# Enhanced Student APIs with Real Data Integration and Mockup Fallbacks

## Overview
Successfully updated all student-facing APIs to fetch real data from teachers while providing comprehensive mockup data as fallbacks. This ensures students always have access to realistic, well-structured content for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Issues Previously Addressed âœ…

### 1. "Due Invalid Date at Invalid Date" in Student Quiz Details
**Problem**: Student quiz pages were showing "Invalid Date" for due dates.

**Solution**: 
- Updated quiz API to return `null` instead of undefined for missing dates
- Enhanced date formatting with null-safe validation
- Now displays "No due date set" instead of "Invalid Date"

### 2. Students Cannot Access Teacher Assignments  
**Problem**: Students had no way to fetch assignments from teachers.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive student assignments API
- Proper teacher-to-student assignment mapping
- Status tracking and submission management

## Technical Architecture

### API Design Pattern
```typescript
// Consistent pattern across all student APIs
1. Authentication validation with JWT tokens
2. Student lookup and school/class identification  
3. Real data queries from teacher collections
4. Fallback to mockup data if no real data exists
5. Data transformation for consistent frontend interface
6. Proper error handling and null safety
```

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Teacher Creates Content â†’ Database Storage â†’ Student API Access â†’ Frontend Display
                                â†“
                           Mockup Fallback (when no real data)
```

### Mockup Data Features
- **Realistic Content**: All mockups use realistic school scenarios
- **Diverse Subjects**: Mathematics, English, Science, Social Studies, Computer Science
- **Varied Statuses**: Different assignment states, due dates, priorities
- **Rich Metadata**: File sizes, download counts, creation dates
- **Teacher Personas**: Consistent teacher names across different content types
